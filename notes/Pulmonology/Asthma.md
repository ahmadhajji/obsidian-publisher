# Asthma

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and underlying inflammation.

## Pathophysiology

The key features are:

1. **Chronic airway inflammation** - Eosinophils, mast cells, T-lymphocytes
2. **Bronchial hyperreactivity** - Exaggerated bronchoconstriction
3. **Reversible airflow obstruction** - Responds to bronchodilators

## Clinical Features

### Symptoms
- Wheezing (expiratory)
- Shortness of breath
- Chest tightness
- Cough (often nocturnal)

> [!TIP]
> Symptoms often worse at night or early morning, and triggered by:
> - Allergens (dust, pollen, pets)
> - Exercise
> - Cold air
> - Respiratory infections

### Physical Exam
- Wheezing on auscultation
- Prolonged expiratory phase
- Use of accessory muscles (severe)
- Nasal polyps (in aspirin-exacerbated disease)

## Diagnosis

### Spirometry (Key Test)
| Parameter | Findings |
|-----------|----------|
| FEV1 | Reduced |
| FVC | Normal or reduced |
| FEV1/FVC | <0.70 (obstructive pattern) |
| Bronchodilator response | ≥12% AND ≥200mL improvement |

### Other Tests
- Peak flow variability >20%
- Methacholine challenge (if spirometry normal)
- Exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) - elevated in eosinophilic asthma
- Allergy testing

## Classification by Severity

```
Intermittent:
  - Symptoms ≤2 days/week
  - Night symptoms ≤2x/month
  - FEV1 ≥80% predicted

Mild Persistent:
  - Symptoms >2 days/week (not daily)
  - Night symptoms 3-4x/month
  - FEV1 ≥80% predicted

Moderate Persistent:
  - Daily symptoms
  - Night symptoms >1x/week
  - FEV1 60-80% predicted

Severe Persistent:
  - Continuous symptoms
  - Frequent night symptoms
  - FEV1 <60% predicted
```

## Treatment

### Quick-Relief Medications

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **SABA** (Short-Acting Beta-Agonist) is the first-line rescue medication
> - Albuterol (salbutamol)
> - Levalbuterol

### Controller Medications (Stepwise Approach)

**Step 1**: SABA as needed
**Step 2**: Low-dose ICS
**Step 3**: Low-dose ICS + LABA
**Step 4**: Medium-dose ICS + LABA
**Step 5**: High-dose ICS + LABA ± add-on therapy
**Step 6**: Oral corticosteroids + biologics

### Biologics for Severe Asthma
- **Omalizumab** - Anti-IgE (allergic asthma)
- **Mepolizumab/Benralizumab** - Anti-IL-5 (eosinophilic)
- **Dupilumab** - Anti-IL-4/13

## Acute Exacerbation Management

> [!CAUTION]
> Signs of life-threatening asthma:
> - Silent chest
> - Cyanosis
> - Altered consciousness
> - SpO2 <92%

Management algorithm:
1. **Oxygen** - Target SpO2 94-98%
2. **SABA nebulizer** - q20min x3, then as needed
3. **Ipratropium** - Add in severe exacerbations
4. **Corticosteroids** - Prednisone 40-60mg PO (or IV methylpred)
5. **Consider**: Magnesium sulfate IV, epinephrine
