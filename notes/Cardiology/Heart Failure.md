# Heart Failure

Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome caused by structural or functional cardiac abnormalities resulting in reduced cardiac output and/or elevated intracardiac pressures.

## Classification

### By Ejection Fraction
- **HFrEF** (Reduced EF): EF ≤40%
- **HFmrEF** (Mildly Reduced EF): EF 41-49%
- **HFpEF** (Preserved EF): EF ≥50%

### By Timing
- **Acute HF**: Rapid onset of symptoms
- **Chronic HF**: Progressive, long-term condition

## Etiology

1. **Ischemic heart disease** (most common)
2. Hypertension
3. Valvular disease
4. Cardiomyopathies
5. Arrhythmias

## Clinical Features

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember the classic presentation:
> - **Left-sided failure**: Dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, pulmonary edema
> - **Right-sided failure**: JVD, peripheral edema, hepatomegaly

### Symptoms
- Dyspnea on exertion
- Orthopnea (need to sleep with pillows)
- Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND)
- Fatigue
- Lower extremity edema

### Signs
- Elevated JVP
- S3 gallop (volume overload)
- Pulmonary crackles
- Peripheral edema
- Hepatomegaly

## Diagnosis

### Labs
| Test | Finding in HF |
|------|---------------|
| BNP | >100 pg/mL suggests HF |
| NT-proBNP | >300 pg/mL in acute setting |
| Troponin | May be elevated in acute HF |

### Imaging
- **Echocardiogram**: Gold standard for EF assessment
- **CXR**: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion
- **Cardiac MRI**: For detailed structural assessment

## Treatment

### Acute Management
```
1. Position: Sit patient upright
2. Oxygen: Target SpO2 ≥94%
3. Diuretics: IV furosemide 40-80mg
4. Vasodilators: Nitrates if BP adequate
5. Consider: Inotropes if cardiogenic shock
```

### Chronic HFrEF (Four Pillars of Therapy)

> [!NOTE]
> Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) includes four classes of drugs that reduce mortality:

1. **ACE inhibitor/ARB/ARNI** - Start low, titrate up
2. **Beta-blocker** (carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, bisoprolol)
3. **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist** (spironolactone, eplerenone)
4. **SGLT2 inhibitor** (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin)

### Device Therapy
- **ICD**: For EF ≤35% after 3 months of GDMT
- **CRT**: For EF ≤35% + LBBB + QRS ≥150ms

## Prognosis

> [!WARNING]
> 5-year mortality is approximately 50% after diagnosis. Early GDMT initiation is crucial!
