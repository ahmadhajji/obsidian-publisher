# Concept 04 - Brutalist Utility

## Design principles
- Minimize ambiguity: every element should read as a tool.
- Prioritize density, speed, and directness over comfort polish.
- Use sharp boundaries and high-contrast labels for scanning.
- Remove decorative gradients and softeners.
- Keep state changes obvious through binary visual switches.
- Favor explicit typography and uppercase utility language.
- Keep interaction targets sturdy and unmistakable.

## Typography choices
- Heading: `Archivo` in heavy uppercase for structural labels.
- Body/UI: `Space Mono` for technical, utilitarian rhythm.
- Single-family utility approach to reduce stylistic noise.

## Color / token palette
- Base: black/white neutral system.
- Alert accent: safety yellow for active attention moments.
- Minimal semantic additions for success/error only.
- Borders: heavy black lines define spatial hierarchy.

## Layout system
- Reversed desktop structure: content first, library rail on the right.
- Strong frame lines around every major region.
- Compact spacing and dense vertical rhythm.

## Component shapes
- Radius: none (0px).
- Borders: thick, explicit, always visible.
- Shadows: none; depth expressed with hard separators only.

## How it differs from other concepts
- Most utilitarian and least ornamental concept.
- Opposite of Concept 02’s rounded friendliness and Concept 05’s softness.
- Sharper and more aggressive than Concept 01 editorial style.
- Less cinematic than Concept 03; more literal and dense.
