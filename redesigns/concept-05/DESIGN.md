# Concept 05 - Calm Clinical

## Design principles
- Create a reassuring, low-stress reading environment.
- Maximize whitespace and pacing for long sessions.
- Use gentle separators instead of heavy framing.
- Keep controls discoverable but visually unobtrusive.
- Prefer typographic warmth with measured contrast.
- Support readability through generous line-height and spacing.
- Preserve interaction clarity with subtle but consistent feedback.

## Typography choices
- Heading: `Newsreader` for calm editorial warmth.
- Body/UI: `Public Sans` for clear modern legibility.
- Utility labels: `IBM Plex Mono` for compact metadata.

## Color / token palette
- Base: soft clinical greens/blues (`#f6faf8`, `#f1f6f4`).
- Text: muted ink tones (`#1d2b2a`, `#3e5854`).
- Accent: restrained blue-teal (`#2f6f8f`).
- Borders: low-contrast dividers (`#d4e3de`, `#c1d6d0`).

## Layout system
- Spacious two-pane workspace with elevated reading card.
- Soft shell around sidebar and content without heavy contrast.
- Larger inner gutters to reduce visual crowding.

## Component shapes
- Radius: medium-soft (10-18px).
- Borders: subtle, low-contrast.
- Shadows: lightweight elevation only for grouping.

## How it differs from other concepts
- Most quiet and whitespace-forward concept.
- Less theatrical than Concept 02 and Concept 03.
- Softer and more reassuring than Concept 01/04’s sharp systems.
- Closest to healthcare-style UX while preserving core app flows.
