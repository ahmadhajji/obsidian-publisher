# Concept 03 - Midnight Command

## Design principles
- Optimize for focused, high-intensity reading and triage.
- Use dark surfaces with luminous accents for scan speed.
- Keep signal density high while preserving hierarchy.
- Emphasize operational confidence with consistent contrast.
- Use glass-like layers to separate navigation and content depth.
- Keep interactions precise with clear active and focus states.
- Maintain accessibility in dark mode with contrast-minded tokens.

## Typography choices
- Heading: `Space Grotesk` for modern, technical confidence.
- Body/UI: `IBM Plex Sans` for clean dense information display.
- Utility labels: `IBM Plex Mono` for diagnostics and metadata.

## Color / token palette
- Base: deep midnight tones (`#070a12`, `#0d1220`).
- Foreground: cool light text (`#f3f6ff`, `#c0cbe3`).
- Accent: cyan (`#22d3ee`) with steel-blue structure tokens.
- Error/success tuned for visibility against dark backgrounds.

## Layout system
- Standard left navigation + main reading pane for speed.
- Glassy sticky header with strong route orientation.
- Tab strip and cards treated as command-console modules.

## Component shapes
- Radius: medium (8-16px).
- Borders: subtle but luminous edge lines.
- Shadows: deep atmospheric shadows to layer panels.

## How it differs from other concepts
- Only dark-mode-first concept with premium console aesthetic.
- More polished and cinematic than Concept 04’s raw utility style.
- More concentrated and high-contrast than Concept 05’s soft whitespace.
- Less decorative/playful than Concept 02; less print-like than Concept 01.
