# Concept 01 - Editorial Grid

## Design principles
- Prioritize reading cadence over dashboard chrome.
- Use an editorial baseline grid and clear column rhythm.
- Keep interaction affordances visible but visually quiet.
- Emphasize hierarchy with type scale, not color noise.
- Favor hard edges and low-decoration surfaces.
- Keep navigation scannable with consistent indents and separators.
- Support dense knowledge reading without cognitive clutter.

## Typography choices
- Heading: `Fraunces` for high-contrast editorial personality.
- Body/UI: `Source Sans 3` for long-form readability.
- Utility labels: `IBM Plex Mono` for metadata and badges.

## Color / token palette
- Canvas: warm paper tones (`#f2efe8`, `#fcfaf6`).
- Ink: neutral charcoal (`#1f2429`, `#4a525c`).
- Accent: restrained blue (`#165c7d`).
- Borders: visible editorial rules (`#d5cec2`, `#bcb3a7`).

## Layout system
- Two-column reading desk: fixed-width library + fluid reading surface.
- Sticky top bar with compact utility tools.
- Wide content column with measured line length for note body.

## Component shapes
- Radius: near-zero (2-6px).
- Borders: always present, thin but visible.
- Shadows: disabled to preserve print-like flatness.

## How it differs from other concepts
- Most typography-driven and least decorative concept.
- Opposite of Concept 02's playful softness and Concept 03's glow effects.
- More humanist and reading-first than Concept 04's utilitarian density.
- More structured and contrasty than Concept 05's airy, calm treatment.
