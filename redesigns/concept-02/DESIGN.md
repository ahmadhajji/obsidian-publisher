# Concept 02 - Playful Studio

## Design principles
- Make the product feel welcoming for frequent daily use.
- Prefer rounded geometry and soft depth cues.
- Use color gradients to segment actions and orientation.
- Keep micro-interactions light and optimistic.
- Preserve clarity with strong labels despite playful tone.
- Reward exploration with obvious affordances.
- Keep text legible with high-contrast foregrounds.

## Typography choices
- Heading: `Baloo 2` for expressive, friendly character.
- Body/UI: `Nunito` for rounded, approachable readability.
- Utility labels: `JetBrains Mono` for technical metadata.

## Color / token palette
- Canvas: pale blue-violet field (`#f6f8ff`, `#eef2ff`).
- Primary text: deep slate blue (`#213053`).
- Accent: bright sky blue (`#3b82f6`) with lavender highlights.
- State colors tuned for high-visibility feedback.

## Layout system
- Floating card architecture over a soft gradient backdrop.
- Rounded header shell + card sidebar + card content viewport.
- Tab rail and panels styled as tactile pill-based controls.

## Component shapes
- Radius: high (12-30px).
- Borders: light, mostly supportive.
- Shadows: soft layered depth (`shadow-sm` to `shadow-lg`).

## How it differs from other concepts
- Most friendly and playful visual language.
- Radically different from Concept 01/04’s hard-edged editorial/brutalist tone.
- Lighter and more cheerful than Concept 03’s dark productivity cockpit.
- More expressive color than Concept 05’s restrained clinical calm.
